The obvious route - Marrakech, one night in the dunes, a photograph of a blue wall in Chefchaouen - is worth doing, but the country only opens up when you stay put long enough to be offered a second glass of tea. Our itineraries build in those afternoons deliberately.',

      'In the cities, Fes el Bali is still the largest car-free urban area in the world and genuinely disorientating, so we walk it with a guide who grew up on the Talaa Kebira. Food is the throughline everywhere: bissara soup for breakfast in Fes, tanjia cooked in the ashes of a hammam furnace in Marrakech, and a lamb and quince tagine that will spoil the version you make at home.',

    excerpt: 'The Valbona Pass is only reliably open for about four months a year, and the difference between the second week of June and the last week of September is bigger than most people expect.',
    body: [
      'The single question we get asked most about Albania is when to go, and the honest answer is that it depends entirely on whether you intend to cross the Valbona Pass. For everything else in the country the season is long and forgiving. For that one day, it is not.',
      'Snow lies on the pass at 1,795 m well into spring. In a normal year the route becomes walkable without axe or crampons somewhere between the first and third week of June, and the guesthouses in Theth and Valbona open at the same time because there is no point opening earlier. We have had years when it cleared in late May and one, in 2023, when a group in the second week of June still crossed a snowfield. If you are booking a June departure, plan for the possibility of a road transfer instead.',
      'July and August are hot, dry and busy by Albanian standards, which still means you will meet perhaps forty people on the pass rather than four hundred. The advantage is certainty: the path is clear, the coffee shack near the top is open every day, and the Koman ferry runs a full timetable. The disadvantage is that the guesthouses fill, and the good ones in Valbona are booked out months ahead.',
      'September is our favourite month and it is not close. The heat has gone out of the valleys, the light is lower and better, the blueberries are finished but the plums are not, and the ferry is quiet enough that you can sit outside. Groups walking in the third week of September regularly have the pass to themselves for the first two hours.',
      'By the second week of October the guesthouses start closing, the ferry drops to one crossing a day, and the first snow can arrive on the tops without much warning. We stop running the crossing after the first week of October, and we would gently discourage anyone from attempting it independently after that without checking conditions in Shkoder first.',
      'One more thing, which has nothing to do with weather: the tunnel that opened in 2022 cut the drive to Theth from four hours of dirt road to about ninety minutes of tarmac. It has made the valley far easier to reach, and the number of guesthouses has roughly doubled since. Theth is still remarkable. It will not be a secret for much longer.',

    excerpt: 'Travelling in Morocco during Ramadan is not a problem to be managed. It is one of the more interesting months to be there, provided you understand what changes and what does not.',
    body: [
      'Every year we get emails asking whether a trip should be moved because it falls in Ramadan. Almost always the answer is no. Ramadan changes the rhythm of the day in Morocco, and if you go in knowing that, it is one of the most rewarding months to visit.',
      'What actually changes: many restaurants in the medinas close during daylight hours, though anywhere serving tourists in Marrakech, Fes or Chefchaouen stays open. Cafes are quieter. Museums and monuments often shift to shorter hours, typically closing by four. Traffic in the hour before sunset is genuinely dangerous because everybody is trying to get home for iftar, so we simply do not schedule drives at that time.',
      'What does not change: the mountains. Our High Atlas trips run through Ramadan every year. Guides who are fasting will tell you honestly whether they are, and most of our mountain guides fast and walk anyway, which is more impressive than it sounds at 2,400 m. We shorten walking days slightly and move lunch stops around, and nobody has ever noticed a drop in the standard of guiding.',
      'Eating and drinking as a visitor is fine. Nobody will comment if you drink water on a mountain path or eat a packed lunch on a pass. In a city street it is considered polite to be discreet rather than to abstain, and stepping into a courtyard or your riad is enough.',
      'Iftar is the reason to go. At sunset the whole country stops and eats at the same moment: harira soup, dates, chebakia pastries, boiled eggs, msemen. If you are invited to a family iftar, accept, arrive with pastries, and do not eat until your host does. We build one into every Morocco departure that falls in the month, and it is invariably the meal people write to us about afterwards.',
      'The last practical note is on prices and crowds. Ramadan is a quieter month for tourism, so flights and riads are cheaper and the sites are emptier. Eid at the end is the opposite: everything closes for two or three days, transport is impossible to book, and we avoid scheduling departures across it.',

    excerpt: 'Most island-hopping itineraries fail for the same reason: they were built from a map instead of a timetable. Here is how we build ours backwards.',
    body: [
      'The Cyclades look like a cluster of islands close enough to pick freely between. The ferry network does not agree. Boats run along lines, not between neighbours, and two islands ten kilometres apart can be a five-hour journey with a change, or simply impossible on a Tuesday.',
      'So we build every island route backwards from the timetable. First we find the islands that are genuinely connected in the season we are travelling, then we decide how long to stay on each, and only then do we write an itinerary. It is why our Cyclades trip goes Naxos, Amorgos, Folegandros rather than the more obvious Naxos, Paros, Santorini: those three sit on lines that actually meet.',
      'Two ferry types matter. The big blue-and-white conventional ships are slower, much cheaper, run in worse weather and have deck seating where you can sit outside for four hours watching islands go past. The high-speed catamarans are half the time, twice the price, cancel in strong meltemi, and have no outside deck at all. For a trip built around slowness, the slow boat is not a compromise.',
      'The meltemi is the real planning constraint. It is a dry north wind that blows in July and August, sometimes for a week at a time, and at force seven or above the fast boats stop. Conventional ferries usually keep going. If your itinerary depends on a catamaran crossing in August with a flight the same evening, you have built a trip with a single point of failure.',
      'Our rule is one buffer night before any flight home. It costs a night of hotel and it removes the only genuinely stressful part of island travel. In eleven years we have used that buffer perhaps a dozen times, and every one of those groups made their flight.',
      'Finally, book the ferries but not everything else. Tickets for the popular summer crossings sell out and should be bought in advance. Restaurants, boat trips and beaches should not be planned at all. The best afternoon on any island trip is the one nobody scheduled.',

    excerpt: 'A support vehicle carries your bag between camps, so the question is not what you own but what goes in the daypack. This is the list our guides actually check.',
    body: [
      'On the Dana to Petra section you walk with a daypack and everything else travels ahead to camp. That sounds like it removes the packing problem. It does not, because the four things that will ruin your week all live in the daypack.',
      'Water first. Our guides carry a reserve, but you should start each day with three litres and a way to drink it without stopping, because people who have to take a pack off to drink simply drink less. Two one-and-a-half litre bottles in the side pockets work as well as a bladder and are easier to refill from a jerrycan.',
      'Sun second. There is very little shade between Wadi Malaga and Ras al-Feid. A brimmed hat, long sleeves in light fabric, and factor fifty applied before you leave camp rather than when you notice. Sunglasses that actually stay on when you look down.',
      'Feet third. Boots or trail shoes you have already walked at least fifty kilometres in, and a spare pair of socks in the pack so you can change at lunch. Bring blister plasters even if you never get blisters, because the sand gets into everything and abrades in places it does not at home. Gaiters are optional but the people who bring them are quietly smug by day three.',
      'Warmth fourth, which surprises people. The desert loses heat fast after sunset, and in March or November a camp at 1,200 m can drop close to freezing. A light down jacket and a warm hat weigh almost nothing and get used every evening. Sleeping bags are provided but a silk liner adds a few degrees and takes no space.',
      'Everything else is optional. A head torch, obviously. Long trousers and a scarf for the monastery visits and for the villages. A power bank, because there is no electricity in camp and you will take more photographs than you expect. And leave the drone at home; Wadi Rum and the Dana reserve both require permits that we cannot obtain for individual travellers.',

    body: [
      'Ohrid trout is protected and has been since the population collapsed in the 1990s. What you are served is farmed, or comes from Lake Prespa over the ridge, and it is genuinely good grilled with oil and lemon. It is also the most expensive thing on the menu and the least surprising, so here is what we order instead.',
      'Tavce gravce, first, always. Beans baked in a clay dish with paprika and onion until the top goes dark, served bubbling. Every restaurant claims theirs is the best and the difference between them is real. It is a two-euro dish that will hold you until dinner.',
      'Ajvar, made in October when the peppers come in, roasted and peeled and cooked down for hours. Almost every family still makes their own, and a guesthouse that puts out a jar of somebody grandmother ajvar at breakfast is a guesthouse worth staying in. Buy a jar at the market; it travels fine.',
      'Then the cheeses. Bieno sirenje from the Shar mountains, kneaded while warm so it comes out stringy and salty. Young brined sirenje that squeaks. Kashkaval for grilling. Ask for a mixed plate and a glass of Vranec, which is the local red and costs less than bottled water.',
      'Pastrmajlija is the one people miss because it looks like a pizza. It is not: it is a boat of bread dough with cubed pork and an egg cracked over it near the end, from Shtip originally, and it is the best thing to eat after a day on the Galichica ridge. Order the one with the egg.',
      'Finish with kifli and a Turkish coffee in the old bazaar, or in season with a bowl of the small wild strawberries that get sold from buckets along the Prespa road. And if somebody offers you homemade rakija at eleven in the morning, that is a normal time, and refusing is harder than accepting.',

    excerpt: 'Every Atlas price is a rule rather than a number typed in by hand, which is why a departure can be cheaper in November without anybody being told a story about it.',
    body: [
      'We have never run a sale where the original price was invented to make the discount look bigger. That practice is common enough in travel that it is worth explaining exactly how our prices work instead, because the answer is boringly mechanical.',
      'Every tour has one base price. Every departure of that tour then has its own price, set by the season it falls in: our peak months carry up to fifteen percent above the base, our quiet months up to twelve percent below. A November departure of the Sahara trip is cheaper than an October one because November is quieter in the Draa valley, not because we decided to run a promotion.',
      'On top of that sit promotions, and a promotion in our system is a rule, never an edited number. It has a start date, an end date, conditions, and a value. When it applies, the original price is still there underneath it and we show both. When it expires, the price returns by itself because nobody ever overwrote it.',
      'That matters for a practical reason. If a member of staff types a discounted price over the original one, the original is gone, and three weeks later nobody can prove what the trip used to cost. Keeping the base price and computing the discount at the moment you look at the page means the was-price on our site is always a price somebody could actually have paid.',
      'Some of our promotions need no code at all. The early bird takes twelve percent off automatically if you book more than ninety days ahead, and the last-minute rule takes twenty percent off anything leaving within three weeks. You do not have to find them, type them or ask about them; if you qualify, the price you see already includes them.',
      'When more than one rule applies, we take the one worth the most to you rather than the one worth the most to us, and we do not stack percentages, because twenty percent plus twenty percent is thirty-six percent and nobody has ever expected that number. If a code you have been sent is worth less than the automatic discount already on the page, we simply keep the better one and tell you so.',
