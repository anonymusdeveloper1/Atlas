              <h2>It started because a trip was cancelled badly</h2>
              <div className="prose" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--s5)' }}>
                <p>
                  In the spring of 2018 Jasna Petrovska was guiding a group of
                  twenty-eight through the Macedonian highlands for an operator
                  who had sold the departure as &ldquo;intimate&rdquo;. Halfway
                  through, head office cancelled the following week&rsquo;s group
                  by email because it had only reached nine bookings. Nine people
                  had booked flights. Nobody phoned them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Atlas was registered eight months later, in January 2019, on two
                  rules that have not moved since. Sixteen travellers is the
                  ceiling, not the target. And a departure is guaranteed the moment
                  it reaches six people — after that it runs, even at a loss, even
                  if half the group cancels the week before.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We ran nine departures in our first year and lost money on four
                  of them. We ran ninety-four last year and lost money on two. The
                  rule has not changed, we have just become better at judging which
                  dates will fill.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div>
              <span className="eyebrow">How a trip gets built</span>
              <h2>Twelve to eighteen months, and a lot of walking</h2>
              <div className="prose" style={{ marginTop: 'var(--s5)' }}>
                <p>
                  Every Atlas itinerary starts with a guide who lives there telling
                  us about a route, not with a search for what sells. Sara then
                  walks it end to end in the season we intend to sell it — not in
                  perfect June weather if the departures are in October.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What follows is the unglamorous part: timing every transfer with
                  a stopwatch, eating in the places we intend to book, sleeping in
                  the rooms, and checking whether the guesthouse actually has the
                  eight rooms it claims. Roughly a third of routes are dropped at
                  this stage. Another third come back shorter than proposed,
                  usually because a driving day that reads as &ldquo;scenic
                  transfer&rdquo; is in reality five hours of switchbacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Only then is the trip costed, priced and published — with the
                  day-by-day itinerary, the honest difficulty grade, and what is
                  and is not included written out on the tour page, before you pay
                  anything.
